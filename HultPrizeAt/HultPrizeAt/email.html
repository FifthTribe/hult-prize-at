Dear Friend,<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you for your interest in bringing our latest program, <strong>Hult Prize at</strong> to your university.  We are actively recruiting campus directors and hope you will apply for the role through the link enclosed. We have also enclosed a link that contains a pdf of the role in detail.<br />
<br />
While we would love to schedule a time to speak with you in person, due to the overwhelming response, we have decided to open a rolling application window to select our host schools and their respective campus directors.  The application won't take you more than 10 minutes to complete and <strong>our final deadline is this Sunday, September 14th at 11:59pm PST</strong>.  It is important to apply sooner than later as we are literally accepting applications on a rolling basis, and may not open additional windows as we have a limited number of campus opportunities.<br />
<br />

I founded the Hult Prize five years ago with one simple vision: introducing the idea that profitable and sustainable businesses were the way forward if we are going to make significant progress in solving the world's toughest social challenges. What started as an awareness movement, has quickly turned into the world's largest student platform for impact.  To think that five years ago, I didn't event know what a social enterprise was. Hardly any success stories to talk about, and very little seed capital to launch audacious and disruptive ideas that could lead to a real breakthrough.  Today, with the help of organizations like our partner Net Impact, social enterprise is as real and vibrant as it has ever been. Non-usual suspects are entering the market. Start-ups that aim to be disruptive are being launched by i-bankers, consultants and rogue entrepreneurs who have identified this unbelievable market segment that is bursting at the seams for innovation. Through the Hult Prize, every single student on the planet has a chance to come up with an idea and get the support they need to launch and scale through funding, training, mentorship and most important, meeting peers and joining a community of next generation leaders who are dedicated to the pursuit of impact.<br />
<br />
We launched Hult Prize at so that we can have 100x the impact.  Those of you that have previously participated in the Hult Prize, know that once you get a taste of what this sector is all about and the opportunities that exist within, that you will never again see the world the same.  Through Hult Prize at we hope that this infection point can come sooner and go beyond the traditional boundaries of the Hult Prize and our regional final locations.  By opening up the Hult Prize to you and your campuses, we hope to reach more students, and through your support we can impact their life trajectories so that no matter what careers they pursuit or companies they launch, that they will forever ask: what can I do to change the world?
<br />
Join us as we build the next big company, designed for impact. Help us launch the next generation of social entrepreneurs by becoming a campus director and leave your mark on the world.<br />
